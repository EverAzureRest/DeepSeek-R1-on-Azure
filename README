# A way to run the FULL DeepSeek-R1 model on Azure Compute

## About
This project indends to show an example of how to run the DeepSeek-R1 model on Azure Compute. 
The intent was to use the full 671b parameter model since Azure AI Foundry is only deploying a distilled model

### Status
Is untested due to lack of available Azure resources to test on.

### Intent
The intent is to show how to deploy the full DeepSeek-R1 model on Azure Compute using Ollama backend and the Ollama Web-UI running on Azure Container Instances. 
Once I can obtain sufficient Azure resources, I will test this deployment and update this README with the results.
